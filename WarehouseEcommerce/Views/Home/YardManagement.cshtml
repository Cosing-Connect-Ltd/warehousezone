                With the constant movement of trailers, your yard is dynamic. Knowing the location and movement of assets and resources is critical to managing a safe and productive yard.<br>
                Zebra Motion Works™ Yard facilitates the continuous flow of material and goods between your transportation systems and distribution centers or manufacturing plants, increases gate transaction speed, improves switcher productivity and ensures the right trailer arrives at the right dock door, at the right time.<br>
                <strong>Manage All Important Assets With Real-time Insights</strong><br>
                When you know where everything is, and its operational status, you gain strategic insights to better predict, manage and optimize your operations to better compete. Use accurate real-time data about yard resources, combined with flexible business rules, to keep equipment and product moving through your yard.<br>
                <strong>Save Time and Money</strong><br>
                Intelligent trailer move assignments and path optimization cut costs by reducing<br>
                switcher deadhead time, resulting in more trailer moves per hour and a reduction in fuel and maintenance expense. Automatic door assignments help keep doors occupied, resulting in less downtime. Automating processes to maximize yard real estate ensures you make the best possible use of every parking space and dock door in your yard.
