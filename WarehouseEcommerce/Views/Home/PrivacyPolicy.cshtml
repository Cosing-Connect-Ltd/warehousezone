            <span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>5. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></span><br>
            We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table
            in paragraph 4 above.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>
            <li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>
            <li>
                Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our<br>
                business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or<br>
                merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may<br>
                use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with
            the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes
            and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our
            instructions.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong></span><br>
            We may share your personal data within the GANE DATASCAN LIMITED Group. This may involve transferring your
            personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of our external third parties may be based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing
            of your personal data may involve a transfer of personal data outside the EEA.<br>
            Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded
            to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level
                of protection for personal data by the European<br>
                Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the<br>
                protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Where we use Group companies and/or certain service providers, we may use<br>
                specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal<br>
                data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European<br>
                Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>7. DATA SECURITY</strong></span><br>
            We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally
            lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your
            personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to
            know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
            confidentiality.<br>
            We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any
            applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>8. DATA RETENTION</strong></span><br>
            <strong>HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?</strong><br>
            We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for,
            including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.<br>
            To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
            sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
            personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
            purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.<br>
            Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention
            policy which you can request from us by contacting us at&nbsp;info@ganedata.co.uk. In some circumstances you
            can ask us to delete your data.<br>
            In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you)
            for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further
            notice to you.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong></span><br>
            Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data
            and those are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request erasure of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Object to processing of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request transfer of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Right to withdraw consent.</li>

        <p>
            If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at by email at&nbsp;info@ganedata.co.uk.<br>
            <strong>NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</strong><br>
            You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
            However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
            Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.<br>
            <strong>WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</strong><br>
            We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right
            to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure
            that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to
            ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.<br>
            <strong>TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND</strong><br>
            We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a
            month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will
            notify you and keep you updated.
        </p>

            business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make
            sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before
            we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities
            where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise

        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong><br>
            You have the right to:<br>
            <strong>Request access</strong>&nbsp;to your personal data (“data subject access request”). This enables you
            to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing
            it.<br>
            <strong>Request correction</strong>&nbsp;of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to
            have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the
            accuracy of the new data you provide to us.<br>
            <strong>Request erasure</strong>&nbsp;of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove
            personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask
            us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to
            processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to
            erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply
            with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the
            time of your request.<br>
            <strong>Object to processing</strong>&nbsp;of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate
            interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you
            want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
            You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
            In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information
            which override your rights and freedoms.<br>
            <strong>Request restriction of processing</strong>&nbsp;of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
            suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:<br>
            (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;<br>
            (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;<br>
            (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise
            or defend legal claims; or<br>
            (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
            grounds to use it.<br>
            <strong>Request the transfer</strong>&nbsp;of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide
            to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
            machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially
            provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.<br>
            <strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong>&nbsp;where we are relying on consent to process your personal
            data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
            consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We
            will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
