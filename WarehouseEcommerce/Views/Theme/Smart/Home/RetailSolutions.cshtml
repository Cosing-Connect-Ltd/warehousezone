                <strong>RFID Inventory Intelligence</strong><br>
                Traditional inventory management methods can’t keep pace with today’s connected consumer demands.
                TrueVUE’s Inventory Intelligence is designed to help using RFID technology and robust inventory software
                to collect meaningful insights that enable a more personalized customer experience through better
                inventory visibility.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our Inventory Intelligence solutions use RFID-enabled hardware and a robust software platform to collect
                near real-time analytics on merchandise as it moves throughout the store. This virtual sightline into
                enterprise-wide inventory helps reduce costly distortion by establishing solid accuracy by item and
                location. Armed with this valuable data, retailers can:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Improve inventory accuracy, assortment planning and store allocation with clear, near real-time
                    visibility into your inventory across all enterprise locations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Minimize out-of-stock and overstock conditions with more frequent cycle counts and sales floor
                    replenishment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reduce markdowns and drive revenue by ensuring all sellable merchandise is properly displayed on the
                    sales floor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Establish a solid foundation for successful unified commerce with enhanced inventory visibility
                    across the enterprise to effectively and confidently fulfill customer orders.
                </li>
            </ul>
